    <h1> Laws of Cooking</h1>
    <h2> This shitty app was inspired by a very un-shitty book. One of my favorite books. <i>The Laws of Cooking</i>, by Chef Justin Warner. Yes, this is a cookbook, but an important one. Warner breaks down flavors into eleven monumental laws, and breaks those laws down into creative and unique recipes. <br>
